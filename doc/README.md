ojacoin
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[ojacoin](https://www.ojacoinproject.org/ojacoin-wallets/) is the original ojacoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of ojacoin transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from one to two hours. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run ojacoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run in terminal:

- ./ojacoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or ./ojacoind (headless, 32-bit)
- ./ojacoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or ./ojacoind (headless, 64-bit)

### Windows

Run the installer, and then run ojacoin-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag ojacoin-Qt to your applications folder, and then run ojacoin-Qt.
